## Requirements

- **WxWidgets**: A GUI library for creating the simulator interface.

### Implemented:
- Simulation of the Round-Robin scheduling algorithm.
- Process manual creation
- Real-time process, queues and primary memory visualization.

---
This project aims to simulate a **dispatcher** (short-term scheduler) using the **Round-Robin** algorithm to allocate processes efficiently. 
The simulator provides a graphical interface for understanding and analyzing how processes are scheduled using a 7 state model in a time-sharing system, as well as real time primary memory frames visualization.
